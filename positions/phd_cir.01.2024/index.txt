We combine excellence in research, teaching, and patient care. The University Hospital Bonn (UKB) is a maximum care hospital with more than 1,300 beds. With around 38 clinics and 31 institutes as well as more than 8,000 employees (over 5,000 full-time staff), the UKB is one of the largest employers in Bonn. Every year, the UKB treats around 50,000 inpatients and around 35,000 emergencies, as well as provides over 350,000 outpatient treatments.


The following **(TVL E13 - 75%) Ph.D. position** is available at the **Computational Imaging Research (CIR) Lab**, headed by Prof. Dr. Shadi Albarqouni, in the **Clinic for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology** of the University Hospital Bonn, University of Bonn:

## **Ph.D. position in AI in Medicine with Large Language Models (m/f/d)** 

starting Oct 2024 or as agreed upon. The position is initially limited to three years, with the possibility of extension.

The Ph.D. position will be based in the newly founded research lab for Computational Imaging Research (CIR), which aims to develop i) fully automated, highly accurate innovative computational methods that save expert labor and efforts, and mitigate the challenges in medical imaging; namely the availability of a few annotated data, low inter-/intra-observers agreement, inter-/intra-scanners variability and domain shift, ii) innovative deep Federated Learning algorithms that can fairly distill and share the knowledge among AI agents in a robust and privacy-preserved way, and iii) affordable AI algorithms suitable for low-quality data generated by low-resource settings and point-of-care devices. As AI technology becomes the de facto knowledge discovery approach in many industries, including Healthcare, robustness, and explainability have emerged as key factors to be considered in [future EU regulations](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC119336).

In this project, the Ph.D. candidate will focus on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into deep learning frameworks for medical imaging. LLMs offer unprecedented capabilities in processing and interpreting unstructured text data, which can be leveraged to enhance image analysis, annotation, and the generation of synthetic data for training models. The candidate will explore the application of LLMs to improve the accuracy and robustness of medical imaging models, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data or when dealing with diverse and complex clinical environments.

The Ph.D. candidate will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between advanced natural language processing techniques and medical image analysis. This includes collaborating with clinicians to identify clinical use cases where LLMs can contribute to improved diagnostic workflows, as well as developing methods to ensure the transparency, interpretability, and regulatory compliance of AI models incorporating LLMs in healthcare.

The Ph.D. candidate will be enrolled in the [the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science](https://www.mnf.uni-bonn.de/promotion) at the University of Bonn. If you have a strong background in deep learning, medical imaging, and an interest in exploring the potential of LLMs within this domain, this position offers a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of AI research in medicine.

**Your responsibilities:**

- Build and create a few clinical use cases for benchmarking existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This includes running baselines and pre-/post-processing pipelines
