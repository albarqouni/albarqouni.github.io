      <description>&lt;p&gt;We combine excellence in research, teaching, and patient care. The University Hospital Bonn (UKB) is a maximum care hospital with more than 1,300 beds. With around 38 clinics and 31 institutes as well as more than 8,000 employees (over 5,000 full-time staff), the UKB is one of the largest employers in Bonn. Every year, the UKB treats around 50,000 inpatients and around 35,000 emergencies, as well as provides over 350,000 outpatient treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;strong&gt;(TVL E13 - 75%) Ph.D. position&lt;/strong&gt; is available at the &lt;strong&gt;Computational Imaging Research (CIR) Lab&lt;/strong&gt;, headed by Prof. Dr. Shadi Albarqouni, in the &lt;strong&gt;Clinic for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology&lt;/strong&gt; of the University Hospital Bonn, University of Bonn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;phd-position-in-ai-in-medicine---robustness-and-explainability-mfd&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ph.D. position in AI in Medicine - Robustness and Explainability (m/f/d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;starting June 2023 or as agreed upon. The position is initially limited to three years, with the possibility of extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ph.D. position will be based in the newly founded research lab for Computational Imaging Research (CIR), which aims to develop i) fully automated, highly accurate innovative computational methods that save expert labor and efforts, and mitigate the challenges in medical imaging; namely the availability of a few annotated data, low inter-/intra-observers agreement, inter-/intra-scanners variability and domain shift, ii) innovative deep Federated Learning algorithms that can fairly distill and share the knowledge among AI agents in a robust and privacy-preserved way, and iii) affordable AI algorithms suitable for low-quality data generated by low-resource settings and point-of-care devices. As AI technology becomes the de facto knowledge discovery approach in many industries, including Healthcare, robustness, and explainability have emerged as key factors to be considered in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC119336&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;future EU regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Current radiomics workflow and DL-based solutions in medical imaging are lagging behind the SOTA in robust and explainable AI. In this project, we aim to broaden and strengthen our knowledge in this field, particularly for critical AI applications in medical imaging and healthcare. The Ph.D. candidate will have the chance to closely work with our clinicians to identify clinical use cases. The Ph.D. candidate will be enrolled in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mnf.uni-bonn.de/promotion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Bonn. If you have experience with computational methods in medical imaging, this is a great opportunity to be part of our team and contribute to AI in Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
